# RPGGame

For the most part, this game walks you through playing. 
Select a character to begin and then battle your way through to the end.

Your goal is to defeat all three combatants. It won't be winnable by every fighter, but if you like Jar Jar give it a go.

You can change their attributes in the console, if you really want to.
